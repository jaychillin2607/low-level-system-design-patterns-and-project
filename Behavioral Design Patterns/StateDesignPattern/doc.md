# **Title**: State Design Pattern Report

## **Introduction**
The State design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. Rather than implementing state-specific logic in a single class, the State pattern delegates behavior to individual state classes. This approach provides flexibility and allows an object to change its behavior dynamically, making it ideal for managing finite state machines, such as UI workflows, or game entities.

## **Easy Definition**
The State pattern allows an object to change its behavior based on its current state, treating each state as a separate object that manages behavior for that state.

## **Why is the State Pattern used?**
- **Reduces Complex Conditional Logic**: By creating separate classes for each state, the pattern avoids long conditional statements and complex if-else blocks in the main class.
- **Enhances Readability and Maintainability**: The pattern keeps each state’s behavior encapsulated, improving code clarity and simplifying future modifications.
- **Promotes Single Responsibility Principle**: Each state class is responsible for handling its specific behavior, which aligns with SRP and results in cleaner code.
- **Supports Dynamic State Transitions**: State objects can trigger transitions between different states at runtime, making it easier to manage complex state-based behavior.

## **When to use the State Pattern**
- When an object’s behavior depends on its state and must change dynamically based on that state.
- When an object has multiple states with specific behaviors that can be encapsulated separately.
- When extensive conditionals are needed to manage state-based behavior, and there’s a need to simplify the control logic.

## **When not to use the State Pattern**
- When the number of states or transitions is small, making a straightforward if-else block simpler and more effective.
- When state transitions are infrequent or unlikely to change, as the overhead of creating multiple state classes may not be justified.
- When the object’s behavior does not depend heavily on its state, and adding state objects would introduce unnecessary complexity.

## **Key Points of the State Pattern**
- **Encapsulates State-Specific Behavior**: Each state has its class with state-specific behavior, allowing the main object to delegate work based on its current state.
- **Enables Dynamic Transitions**: State objects control transitions, allowing flexible movement between states without modifying the core class.
- **Promotes Open/Closed Principle**: Adding new states only requires creating new classes without modifying the main class or existing states.
- **Simplifies Complex State Logic**: By distributing behavior across multiple classes, the State pattern keeps each state manageable and reduces the main class’s complexity.

## **Code Example Without State Pattern**
```java
// Without State Pattern, the Document class contains conditional logic to manage different states, resulting in bloated code.

class Document {
    private String state = "Draft";

    public void publish() {
        if (state.equals("Draft")) {
            state = "Moderation";
            System.out.println("Document sent for moderation.");
        } else if (state.equals("Moderation")) {
            state = "Published";
            System.out.println("Document published.");
        } else if (state.equals("Published")) {
            System.out.println("Document is already published.");
        }
    }

    public void review() {
        if (state.equals("Moderation")) {
            state = "Draft";
            System.out.println("Document returned to draft.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Review is only applicable from moderation state.");
        }
    }
}

// Client code
class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Document doc = new Document();
        doc.publish(); // Moves to Moderation
        doc.publish(); // Moves to Published
        doc.review();  // Prints message as review is only applicable from Moderation
    }
}
```

### **Issues in the Above Code**
- **Complex Conditionals**: The `Document` class contains nested conditionals, which make the code difficult to maintain and extend.
- **Violation of Single Responsibility**: The `Document` class handles both the logic for state transitions and state-specific behaviors, leading to tightly coupled code.
- **Difficult to Extend**: Adding new states would require modifying the `Document` class, which violates the Open/Closed Principle.

## **Improved Code Using the State Pattern**
```java
// State interface that defines the behavior for each state
interface DocumentState {
    void publish(Document context);
    void review(Document context);
}

// Context class that delegates behavior to its current state
class Document {
    private DocumentState state;

    public Document() {
        this.state = new DraftState(); // Initial state is Draft
    }

    public void setState(DocumentState state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void publish() {
        state.publish(this); // Delegate to current state
    }

    public void review() {
        state.review(this); // Delegate to current state
    }
}

// Concrete State: Draft
class DraftState implements DocumentState {
    public void publish(Document context) {
        context.setState(new ModerationState());
        System.out.println("Document sent for moderation.");
    }

    public void review(Document context) {
        System.out.println("Draft can't be reviewed.");
    }
}

// Concrete State: Moderation
class ModerationState implements DocumentState {
    public void publish(Document context) {
        context.setState(new PublishedState());
        System.out.println("Document published.");
    }

    public void review(Document context) {
        context.setState(new DraftState());
        System.out.println("Document returned to draft.");
    }
}

// Concrete State: Published
class PublishedState implements DocumentState {
    public void publish(Document context) {
        System.out.println("Document is already published.");
    }

    public void review(Document context) {
        System.out.println("Published document cannot be reviewed.");
    }
}

// Client code
class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Document doc = new Document();
        doc.publish(); // Moves to Moderation
        doc.publish(); // Moves to Published
        doc.review();  // Prints message as review is only applicable from Moderation
    }
}
```

### **Improvements in the Above Code**
- **Encapsulation of State Behavior**: Each state (Draft, Moderation, Published) is encapsulated in its own class, separating behavior and enhancing code clarity.
- **Simplified Transitions**: The state classes manage transitions, reducing the `Document` class's complexity and improving readability.
- **Extensibility**: Adding new states only requires creating new classes, without modifying the `Document` or other state classes, thus following the Open/Closed Principle.
- **Single Responsibility**: The `Document` class focuses on delegation, while each state class handles specific behaviors, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

## **Considerations for Effective Use of the State Pattern**
- **Complex State-Dependent Logic**: Use the State pattern when state-specific logic becomes difficult to manage through conditionals and affects code readability.
- **Consistent State Transitions**: Ensure well-defined transitions between states to avoid inconsistent behavior. Define clear rules within state classes to prevent invalid transitions.
- **Memory and Performance**: Consider memory usage, as each state is encapsulated in a separate class. For frequently changing states, ensure performance considerations are addressed, especially in memory-constrained environments.

## **Conclusion**
The State pattern is a powerful tool for managing complex, state-dependent behavior, allowing an object to dynamically change its behavior as its state changes. By encapsulating state-specific behavior in separate classes, this pattern reduces complex conditionals, improves maintainability, and provides flexibility for future extensions. However, it is best suited for scenarios where the state transition logic is complex or frequently modified, as it introduces additional classes for each state. When implemented thoughtfully, the State pattern promotes clean, modular code, supporting maintainable and extensible systems.
