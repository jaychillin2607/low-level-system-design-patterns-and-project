# **Title**: Visitor Design Pattern Report

## **Introduction**
The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to add new operations to classes without modifying them. This pattern introduces a "visitor" object that performs operations on elements of an object structure, making it easy to apply a set of diverse operations to objects of varying classes without changing their structure. Visitor is particularly useful when dealing with complex object structures or collections where several different operations need to be applied independently.

## **Source Definition (Exact)**
> "Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates."  
> â€” GoF (Gang of Four) Design Patterns Book

## **Easy Definition**
The Visitor pattern enables adding new operations to classes without modifying their source code by creating a visitor class that can operate on objects of different classes.

## **Why is the Visitor used?**
- **Separates Operations from Object Structure**: The pattern allows new operations to be added independently of the objects they operate on, following the Open/Closed Principle.
- **Simplifies Complex Hierarchies**: The Visitor pattern is well-suited for complex structures where multiple distinct operations are needed across multiple classes.
- **Improves Maintainability**: By centralizing operations in visitor classes, the pattern makes it easier to add or modify operations in a single location without altering existing classes.
- **Supports Open/Closed Principle**: This pattern allows classes to remain closed for modification but open for extension, as new operations can be added without altering existing code.

## **When to use the Visitor**
- When you have a stable structure of classes that requires frequent addition of new operations.
- When multiple, unrelated operations need to be performed on objects from different classes in a structured way.
- When you want to centralize operations in one place, making code easier to read and maintain.
- When classes may evolve independently, but new functionality is frequently added to the structure as a whole.

## **When not to use the Visitor**
- When the class structure is likely to change frequently, as Visitor relies on stable classes to work effectively.
- When only a few operations are needed, since Visitor can add unnecessary complexity for simpler scenarios.
- When adding new element classes frequently, as each new element requires changes to the visitor interface and all visitor implementations, which can increase maintenance.

## **Key Points of the Visitor**
- **Double Dispatch**: Visitor achieves double dispatch by allowing operations to be determined based on both the visitor and the visited object type.
- **Centralized Operations**: Operations are separated into visitor classes, providing a single place to maintain related functionality.
- **Decoupled Operations from Object Structure**: The visitor pattern decouples the operation logic from the objects being operated upon, promoting clean, maintainable code.
- **Improved Extensibility**: New operations can be added without modifying existing object structures, aligning with the Open/Closed Principle.

## **Code Example Without Visitor Pattern**
```java
// Without Visitor, each class has its own logic for operations like export, creating redundancy.

interface Shape {
    void draw();
    void exportToPDF();
    void exportToSVG();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }

    @Override
    public void exportToPDF() {
        System.out.println("Exporting Circle to PDF");
    }

    @Override
    public void exportToSVG() {
        System.out.println("Exporting Circle to SVG");
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Rectangle");
    }

    @Override
    public void exportToPDF() {
        System.out.println("Exporting Rectangle to PDF");
    }

    @Override
    public void exportToSVG() {
        System.out.println("Exporting Rectangle to SVG");
    }
}

// Client code has to call specific methods on each shape, making it hard to add new operations.
class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle();
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle();

        circle.draw();
        circle.exportToPDF();
        rectangle.draw();
        rectangle.exportToSVG();
    }
}
```

### **Issues in the Above Code**
- **Tightly Coupled Operations**: Each shape contains operation logic like `exportToPDF` and `exportToSVG`, making the classes harder to maintain.
- **Redundant Code**: Similar code exists across classes, violating the DRY principle.
- **Limited Extensibility**: Adding new operations like `exportToJPEG` would require modifying all existing shapes, increasing the risk of bugs.

## **Improved Code Using the Visitor Pattern**
```java
// Visitor Interface with visit methods for each Shape
interface Visitor {
    void visit(Circle circle);
    void visit(Rectangle rectangle);
}

// Concrete Visitor for exporting shapes to PDF
class PDFExportVisitor implements Visitor {
    @Override
    public void visit(Circle circle) {
        System.out.println("Exporting Circle to PDF");
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(Rectangle rectangle) {
        System.out.println("Exporting Rectangle to PDF");
    }
}

// Concrete Visitor for exporting shapes to SVG
class SVGExportVisitor implements Visitor {
    @Override
    public void visit(Circle circle) {
        System.out.println("Exporting Circle to SVG");
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(Rectangle rectangle) {
        System.out.println("Exporting Rectangle to SVG");
    }
}

// Element Interface with accept method
interface Shape {
    void accept(Visitor visitor);
}

// Circle class implementing Shape
class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}

// Rectangle class implementing Shape
class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}

// Client code uses visitor to apply operations on shapes without modifying Shape classes.
class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle();
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle();

        Visitor pdfExportVisitor = new PDFExportVisitor();
        Visitor svgExportVisitor = new SVGExportVisitor();

        circle.accept(pdfExportVisitor); // Export Circle to PDF
        circle.accept(svgExportVisitor); // Export Circle to SVG
        rectangle.accept(pdfExportVisitor); // Export Rectangle to PDF
        rectangle.accept(svgExportVisitor); // Export Rectangle to SVG
    }
}
```

### **Improvements in the Above Code**
- **Separated Operations**: The visitor classes (`PDFExportVisitor`, `SVGExportVisitor`) encapsulate operations independently of the `Shape` classes, following the Open/Closed Principle.
- **Centralized Logic**: Export logic is consolidated in visitor classes, improving readability and making maintenance easier.
- **Enhanced Extensibility**: Adding a new operation (e.g., `JPEGExportVisitor`) only requires creating a new visitor class without modifying any shape classes, making the code more modular.

## **Considerations for Effective Use of the Visitor Pattern**
- **Stable Object Structure**: The visitor pattern is best used in cases where the object structure is stable, as changes to element classes require updates to all visitors.
- **Operation Scope**: Define operations carefully to avoid the visitor classes becoming overly complex and taking on too many responsibilities.
- **Double Dispatch Requirement**: Ensure that the visitor pattern is required, as it introduces double dispatch to execute operations based on both the visitor and the visited element.

## **Conclusion**
The Visitor pattern is a powerful way to add operations to an existing object structure without modifying the classes themselves, making it a valuable tool when dealing with complex systems where operations frequently change. By externalizing operations, it enhances maintainability and supports the Open/Closed Principle. However, it is essential to use this pattern in scenarios where the object structure is unlikely to change frequently, as each modification to the elements requires adjustments across all visitor implementations. The Visitor pattern is particularly effective when a clear separation between operations and data structure is needed, helping to keep the system modular and adaptable.
